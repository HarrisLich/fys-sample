                <p>
                    Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a Gothic novel that tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, a young
                    scientist who creates a monstrous creature in his laboratory. The novel is told through a series of
                    letters, journal entries, and narrative frames, and is set in the late eighteenth and early
                    nineteenth centuries.

                    Victor Frankenstein is a brilliant but obsessive student who becomes fascinated with the idea of
                    creating life. After years of research and experimentation, he succeeds in animating a human-like
                    creature using a combination of science and alchemy. However, he is horrified by the creature's
                    appearance and abandons it, leaving it to fend for itself in a hostile world.

                    The creature, rejected by society and driven by a desperate need for companionship, seeks out Victor
                    and demands that he create a mate for him. Victor initially agrees, but ultimately decides that he
                    cannot go through with it, fearing the consequences of creating another monster. The enraged
                    creature vows revenge, and begins a campaign of terror that ultimately leads to the deaths of
                    several of Victor's loved ones.
