                    Beloved is a novel by Toni Morrison that tells the story of Sethe, a former slave who has escaped to Ohio in 1873 with her daughter Denver. Sethe is haunted by the memory of her past, particularly the death of her baby daughter, whom she killed rather than let her be returned to slavery. When a mysterious young woman named Beloved appears at Sethe's doorstep, Sethe is convinced that she is the ghost of her dead daughter. As Beloved becomes more and more intertwined with Sethe's life, she threatens to destroy the fragile peace that Sethe has built for herself and her family.
